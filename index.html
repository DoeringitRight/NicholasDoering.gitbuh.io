        <p>
          Let me tell you a little bit about me. I am currently a first year engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My major is Electrical Engineering with a computer focus. I picked this major because of my love of electronics and my desire to understand how they function and hope that one day, I would be able to make them myself. Since coming to RIT I have found out that there is a ton of different major related electives you can take depending on your focus. I picked the computer focus because it most closely aligned with what interests me most about electronics, computers and other consumer electronics. The class that taught me HTML, which I am using to build and develop this website, was not actually part of my major. I took it because I had accidently signed up for a 600-level writing class that needed me to read a whole book and write numerous essays weekly. That seemed a little extreme to me, esspecially with my current course load so I dropped it and picked up Digital Foundations. It was a great choice, all of the stuff I've been learning has been fascinating. Also my Digital Foundation professor didn't force me to say that. I actually do believe it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website was created by me to showcase my experience with HTML website creation as well as to create a place to put information about myself, including my personal and professional interests. It is constantly changing depending on the new stuff I learn or what I think would look cool. While it is a personal website with alot of elements regarding my educational and professional background, it is something I do in my free time so I like to keep it light and fun as well, hence the photos below this paragraph. If you're looking at this as a potential employer, please ignore the jokes, unless you like them and they help my chances. =)
